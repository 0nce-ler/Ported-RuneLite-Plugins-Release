Runelite Ported Plugins

This is a repo of releases from ported plugins from all over the community a group of people have collected and put together. We have only gathered them this is not our work. I just want to put them all in one place for the community. As of recently a free runelite sideloader came out for plugins and i just feel like this will be helpful. You can find it in my forks called ethanvannplugins you just run it and it creates a sideloader/external plugins folder.If you wish me to take any down just let me know. I just want to help out the community.I'll throw up the release then ill extract them and throw up the source later feel free to pop them in recaf/IDE etc to look at the source. Thanks to the devs who ported these and the several people that gathered these and put this all together. Depending on your runelite client some may work for you some may not. I recently just found another repo called kotori plugins so all of them should work and be maintained so if he has the same ones use his way better and maintained and if his loader does not work for you he has individual plugins in his release. I just want the PvMers in the community to have PvM plugins.
